                <h1>Comedy Movies</h1>
                <p>
                    In the realm of cinema, comedy films, sometimes referred to as comedies, are a well-liked subgenre. 
                    These films aim to make viewers laugh by providing amusing and humorous moments that uplift and 
                    lighten our lives. Similar to romantic comedies, comedies have long been a staple of the cinematic experience and 
                    offer amusement that cuts over cultural barriers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "rom-com," or romantic comedy, is one of the most well-liked comedy film subgenres. 
                    These movies frequently center on a couple who fall in love despite numerous challenges, and 
                    they frequently include endearing protagonists, funny one-liners, and touching scenes. When Harry Met Sally,
                    Sleepless in Seattle, and You've Got Mail are some well-known rom-com examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The action comedy genre of comedies is also quite common. 
                    These movies have a comedic protagonist who is a good fighter but also has a quick wit, 
                    and they frequently feature exciting action sequences. The Rush Hour series, the Lethal Weapon series, 
                    and 21 Jump Street are some of the most well-known action comedies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another comedic subgenre that has grown in popularity recently is parody films. 
                    These movies parody other movies or pop culture, frequently employing inflated characters 
                    and scenarios for hilarious effect. The Naked Gun, Airplane!, and Scary Movie 
                    are a few examples of parody movies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these subgenres, comedy films exist in a wide variety of styles to suit various preferences. 
                    Others are subtler and focus on smart speech and deft wordplay, 
                    while some comedies are more slapstick-oriented and rely more on physical humor and exaggerated motions. 
                    Here are some of the greatest comedies ever made, in no particular sequence.
